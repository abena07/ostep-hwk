### ostep homework

this repository contains my practice exercises for the book **operating systems: three easy steps**.
homeworks are organized by chapter.

#### how to run a program

```bash
# navigate to the chapter folder
cd ch[x]

# compile the c program
gcc q[x].c -o q[x]

# run the executable
./q[x]
```

**notes:**

* replace `[x]` with the appropriate chapter or question number.
* make sure you have `gcc` installed on your system.
